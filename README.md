# Bug Tracker
This is a bug tracker designed as a learning exercise and to add to my portfolio.

## Git Practices

### Branches
1. Create a new branch for any new feature, bug fix etc.
1. Name the new branch with the appropriate prefix (see below) and a short but descriptive name - do not include issue tags if dealing with an issue
1. After pushing to GitHub, create a PR from the new branch into the `main` branch
1. Explain what the purpose of the new code / documentation in the PR.
1. Keep PR's small but frequent

### Commit Messages
1. Keep commits frequent and small
1. Have descriptive commit messages with the appropriate prefix (see below)

### Prefixes

| Prefix | Description |
| -- | -- |
|docs/*description*|Used when working on documentation|
|feat/*description*|Used when creating a new feature|
|fix/*description*|Used when fixing a bug|
|dir/*description*|Used when modifying the directories|
